### Receiving OSC
All of Timeliners current values are being sent via UDP using the OSC protocoll. Specify a target IP address (default: 127.0.0.1 ie. localhost) and a port (default: 4444) via Main Menu -> OSC.

All values are sent in one OSC-Bundle. The individual messages addresses comprise of the specified "Prefix" + the pinname. e.g.:
* /timeliner/Value 0
* /timeliner/String 0

### Sending OSC
TimelinerSA can be remote controlled via OSC commands. It listenes to commands sent to the port set via the "Receive Port" numberbox in the interface (which defaults to 5555).

Send the commands to the "Prefix" + the command you like to controll. e.g.:

play: takes 0 (pause) or 1 (play) as argument

/timeliner/play 1

stop: no arguments

/timeliner/stop

seek: takes a single floating point value to specify the time to seek to

/timeliner/seek 0.234

loop: takes two floating point values to specify the loops in and out points

/timeliner/loop 0.456 1.234

### Web Access

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4444 with your browser to see a list of available timelines.

If you want to access a timeline other than via localhost make sure to run TimelinerSA.exe as admin.
